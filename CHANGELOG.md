### Added

- Day-0 project skeleton: charter, governance, GitFlow, code of conduct, security policy.
- `.hive/` definition of the autonomous AI development team.
- `.hive/memory/` persistent shared memory (append-only JSONL).
- RFC-0000 RFC template and RFC-0001 draft (Trunk + Synapse storage layer).

- Cargo workspace stub with `mycelium-core`, `mycelium-hyphae`, `mycelium-pack`, `mycelium-cli`, `mycelium-mcp` crates.
- First language packs: Python and TypeScript skeletons under `packs/`.
- `mycelium-core`: RFC-0002 `Extractor` — tree-sitter → Store bridge; parses Python source files and populates `Trunk` nodes + `Contains` edges for modules, functions, classes, methods, and imports.
- `mycelium-pack`: language pack loader (`LanguagePack::load`) with `pack.toml` manifest parsing and query-source validation.
- `mycelium index <path>`: first end-user-visible CLI command — walks a directory tree, extracts Python symbols via RFC-0002 `Extractor`, and reports file/error counts.
